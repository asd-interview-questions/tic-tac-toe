# Problem - Tic Tac Toe Web Application

You are tasked with creating a Tic Tac Toe web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow two players to take turns playing the game.

2. Implement the game logic using JavaScript to handle player moves, win conditions, and draw scenarios.
3. Display the current player's turn and game status (win, draw) on the web page.
4. Allow players to click on empty cells to make their moves. Prevent players from overwriting existing moves.
5. When a player wins, highlight the winning cells and display a congratulatory message.
6. When the game ends in a draw, display a message indicating the draw.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Correctness of the game logic.
